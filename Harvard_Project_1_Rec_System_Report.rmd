Introduction:

Data science is the study of data in various forms to derive insights
and in this context to use for business applications to achieve a
predefined result. Businesses operate in many different ways and they
value different ways of conducting business to achieve predefined
results. Businesses within the movie domain, recommendation systems are
built using a variety of techniques tailored to enhance user
satisfaction and engagement (Papneja, 2022). Furthermore, businesses
understand they can create a better user experience and customer
engagement from using data to create recommendation systems to recommend
movies to users that have high probabilities of the user liking and
enjoying the recommendation. Recommendations are based on previous
insight of user behavior and previous likes and reviews that's given.
This data is analyzed and used to create a infrastructure to make
recommendations and have a high statistical probability users will have
a heightened experience therefore retaining customers long term, which
increases life time value per user. Recommender systems have proven to
generate measurable business value, especially in industries like online
streaming, where user retention is critical (Jannach, 2019).

For example, one of the most popular recommendation systems is Netflix.
When a business improves their recommendation system to an optimal level
this in turn creates multiple effects, one dominant effect as stated
before is user or customer retention. Retention is directly linked to
higher revenues over the long term. All businesses desire to maximize
profits and to grow continuously so by having high retention this equals
larger revenue over longer periods of time. To achieve high retention
and stabilize long term profits, in this context enhancing
recommendation systems through data science techniques helps businesses
continue to grow. Modern recommendation systems increasingly rely on
deep learning techniques to model user preferences and improve
predictive accuracy (Zhang, 2017)

As mentioned earlier, advancing recommendation systems are proven ways
to help grow revenue but here I will explore the creation of a movie
recommendation system using a movie dataset. Here, I will apply data
science techniques to create a movie recommendation system. Once the
movie recommendation system, also known as the algorithm, is created
next I will train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs in one
subset to predict movie ratings in the validation set. Once the
algorithm reaches its final form, its final test is to see how accurate
the algorithm is when it is to predict movie ratings. The algorithm is
compared to the final holdout test set as if they were unknown. The Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate how close my predictions
were to the true values in the final holdout test set. The business
problem that's solved here is to create a movie recommendation system
that helps increase user retention, which increases the lifetime value
per customer and eventually leads to higher revenue per customer over a
long period of time. If a movie recommendation system is created then
this enhances the business value by retaining users longer so the result
is more sales from paid subscriptions. Once the recommendation system is
created the model that's developed will not only be evaluated using the
root mean square error (RMSE) metric but also using a final hold out
test set to test the actual model predictions for accuracy.

Data & Methods
The dataset being used in this project is from a tiny subset of a substantially larger dataset that involves millions of ratings. The original mega data set is from the GroupLens organization. GroupLens is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science andEngineering at the University of Minnesota. The concentration is inrecommender systems, online communities, mobile and certain types of technologies, digital libraries, and local geographic information
systems. A big part of solving problems using data is making sure data
is from reputable sources and this group lens organization meets this
criteria. It is important to not rush the process and to ensure the data
being used is a good match for the problem that's trying to be solved
and that the quality of data is as close to superb as possible. As
critical and important as the data is, the methods are also important.
The methods that will be used in this project will be the Cross-Industry
Standard Process for Data Mining, which is the CRISP-DM framework.
Briefly, the CRISP-DM will follow the below phases: (1) confirming
business understanding and problem to be solved as well as the desired
business outcome or results. (2) Data understanding through observing
overview of data. (3) Data preparation through data cleaning,
constructing and organizing in preparation for data exploration to occur
right after the preparation stage (4) Modeling stage is performed and
designed is finalized (5) Evaluation is executed and next steps are
determined along with future improvements noted (6) Deployment of
algorithm as I monitor to improve and adjust accordingly relative to
business objectives.

Data Explore

In this dataset, as I explored it there were 9000055 rows & 6 columns.
All of the following is general information to help understand the
context and body of the data.There are no zero star reviews and upon
further review from other sources and society doesn't typically see zero
star reviews. The four star review was selected the most compared to the
others. There are 10,677 unique or distinct movies in total. The total
user count is 69,878. I will not list the total ratings for each genre
but here is a sample: Drama: 3,910,127 ; Comedy: 3,540,930 ; Thriller:
2,325,899 ; Romance: 1,712,100. The movie Pulp Fiction had the greatest
number of ratings. The three most submitted ratings in order from the
most to the least were the 4 star, 3 star and 5 star. Summary statistics
were observed to gauge greater depth of dataset as it relates to the
goal of predicting future movie ratings. The total average movie rating
across the entire dataset was 3.5 stars. The overall goal is to predict
future movie ratings so the variables selected for the predictors,
influencers or factors are the userId, movieId and genres while the
target variable is ratings. The model used will be a random forest. Key
visualizations but not limited to these include (1) exploration of
Average Rating vs Number of Ratings (2) Low Average Ratings vs Number of
Ratings (3) High Ratings vs Number of Ratings (4) Average Movie Rating
Over Time.

Figure 1

```

The average movie rating mentioned earlier in this project is 3.5 and this is confirmed from figure one above. Overall, in figure 1 there
is a weak nonlinear expression from the data. This means that there is
no strong correlation from the average rating vs the number of ratings.
At the start of the average ratings the line begins not too far above
from -3. As the number of ratings increase the average ratings decline
to an all time low then rises again slowly to where it finishes just
under -4. No real correlation here with these variables but still
critical in pointing out to us the right direction even if it is away
from these variables.

Figure 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Mtize/Desktop/MY_LIFE_VISION/DS_Remote_Agenda/Harvard_Projects/Harvard_Pro_2/media/Img2.png")
```

Altogether, figure 2 has a weak non-linear expression coming from
low average ratings compared to the number of ratings. There is no
strong correlation. At the start the low average rating is between 1.75
and 2. As the number of ratings rise the low average rating increases
for a period then declines before rising again. The end point for the
low average rating is in between 2.25 and 2.5. This gives us insight
into understanding what variables to focus more on or less of when it
comes to finding variables with strong correlations.

Figure 3

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Mtize/Desktop/MY_LIFE_VISION/DS_Remote_Agenda/Harvard_Projects/Harvard_pro_2/media/Img3.png")
```

When examining the high average ratings compared to the number of
ratings there is a weak correlation that is nonlinear. High average
ratings start out at just under 4.7 then rises to just under 4.8 as the
number of ratings go up. As the number of ratings keep going up the high
average ratings drop to an all time lowest high average rating at
slightly above 4.6. Lastly, as the number of ratings continuously climbs
up the high average ratings end point is at or around 4.7. The variables
here serve to push the data exploration toward or away from variables
that have high correlations so adjustments can be made to uncover
underlying trends.

Figure 4

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Mtize/Desktop/MY_LIFE_VISION/DS_Remote_Agenda/Harvard_Projects/Harvard_pro_2/media/Img4.png")
```

Figure 4 demonstrates that the average ratings for movies over
time has fluctuated up and down from around 3.5 stars in the year 1995
to ending around 3.45 stars in 2010. The overall average movie rating
from the data set is 3.5 stars but during the historical review
beginning in 1995 and going until 2010 the average movie rating as
mentioned previously stops at 3.45 stars.

Below is figure 5, which shows average rating from users and the movie
plus it incorporates genre. The goal of this project is to create a
movie recommendation system. During the data explore phase from previous
visuals of many variables there were weak correlations related to
predicting future movie ratings. However, as I explored further, I
decided to select my predictor variables to be User ID, Movie ID and
Genres. I believe these combined will produce accurate predictions of
future movie ratings. Figure 5 expresses the user ID on the x-axis while
the movie ID is on the y-axis. The average rating is marked by color and
is anything from 1 star all the way to 5 stars. Figure 5

Modeling & Evaluation 

Modeling in the field of data science,refers to the process of developing a mathematical or computational representation of a real-world system. This representation, known as a model, is constructed using historical or observed data to capture underlying patterns and relationships. These models are designed to either explain behaviors or predict future outcomes based on past trends.

When used specifically for forecasting, this process is called
predictive modeling. Predictive modeling involves applying statistical
or machine learning algorithms to historical datasets in order to make
informed predictions about future or unseen data. These models are
trained on known input-output pairs and then tested for their ability to
generalize to new scenarios. There are many common techniques used in
prediction. (Kuhn & Johnson, 2013).

The data was split 80% for training and 20% for testing because this
balance gives a good amount of data for the model to learn trends while
reserving an amount of unseen data to fairly evaluate its performance.
This split helps make sure the model generalizes well without
overfitting. As far as other ratios like 70/30 or 90/10 can be used
depending on dataset size and goals, I decided on 80/20 because it is a
common, effective standardized industry default for the overall project
objectives.

For this project, I applied the random forest model because numerous
publications have used this as a basis and is a trusted model in this
sector for high accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using
mathematical metrics. There are several and the one used in this project
is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The application of predictive
modeling for movies is movie rating predictions, which play a major role
in recommendation systems. These systems predict a user's potential
rating for a movie they have not yet watched, thereby enabling
personalized movie recommendations. These predictions are a continuous
rating value from 5 stars to 1 star ratings.

There are two modeling approaches but are used in combination, which are
collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative
filtering focuses on patterns in user behavior. It assumes that if two
users have historically rated movies similarly, then one user is likely
to enjoy movies the other has liked. One predictor variable out of
others used, userId, is present in the dataset so we know the
collaborative approach is in motion. In contrast, content-based
filtering relies on attributes of the movies themselves, such as genre,
director, cast, or keywords. The system uses this information, along
with user preferences, to predict ratings for movies with similar
characteristics. The content-based modeling approach is present due to
the movie genre selected as one of the predictors used to forecast movie
ratings.

Both approaches are present in the system so this would be a hybrid
modeling approach, which utilizes both collaborative and content-based
approaches to advance prediction accuracy and makeup for the limitations
of each individual method. These models benefit from the strengths of
both strategies: the understanding of user behavior from collaborative
filtering and the descriptive power of content-based features make movie
prediction more accurate working together compared to working
independently of each other. In total, the predictor variables I chose
were User ID, Movie ID and genre while the target variable is movie
ratings.

To develop these models, user-movie rating data is split into training
and test sets. The training data is used to fit the model, and its
performance is validated using the test set. Evaluation metrics such as
RMSE determine how accurately the model can predict unseen ratings
(Ricci, Rokach, & Shapira, 2015).

Below is Figure 6 and it is the random forest regression model output
information. Figure 6

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Mtize/Desktop/MY_LIFE_VISION/DS_Remote_Agenda/Harvard_Projects/Harvard_pro_2/media/Img6.png")
```

Below here is Figure 7, which displays the RMSE score from the model's
performance evaluation. Figure 7

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Mtize/Desktop/MY_LIFE_VISION/DS_Remote_Agenda/Harvard_Projects/Harvard_pro_2/media/Img7.png")
```
The RMSE is too high at 0.9537 so an ensemble averaging approach is
implemented to combine predictions of my random forest model and a
baseline model with regularized movie plus user effects. In figure 8
below, the RMSE is 0.8622, which is an acceptable RMSE score. At first
the RMSE score from the ensemble model was not acceptable. When the
model was given different weighted averages so the weight of the
predictions lean more toward the better model this gave the model an
acceptable RMSE score.

Results, Discussion & Conclusion 

The purpose of this project is to create a recommendation system to predict future movie ratings. Business problems can range but here let's assume a business wants higher user retention as they know the longer they keep a user watching movies the longer they pay subscription fees so it creates increased revenue and longer lifetime value per user. In the creation of this recommendation system, the business problem is solved. The results from this project show that using a hybrid collaborative and content-based modeling
approach was the best option in constructing the random forest model for
accurate future movie predictions. The result from the predictive
ensemble model with the weighted averages, after evaluation has a RMSE
score of 0.8622, which is appropriate for machine learning models. In
conclusion, There are several actions that were not taken that could
have led to possibly a more accurate predictive model such as adding
more data or using different evaluation metrics. There is always room
for improvement and future similar projects may consider other
approaches and methodologies. From a global view, user behavior,
technology and new inventions can totally change how we use data science
to solve business problems. For businesses and professionals to keep
their strong abilities to solve complex problems it's important to
continue to learn and apply high performing methods to reach desired
outcomes.
