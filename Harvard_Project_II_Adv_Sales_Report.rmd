> **Introduction:**
>
> Can business success be guaranteed? If success in business was
> guaranteed would you believe it? If only a small number of businesses
> achieve a hyper-growth business scale then there has to be strong
> indicators that if followed, if this doesn\'t guarantee success it
> will at least give you the highest statistical probability of reaching
> it. So maybe success cannot be guaranteed in business but what if the
> framework and strategic approach to conducting business can be
> guaranteed so that this gives companies the best chances of reaching
> hyper growth revenue levels. High company revenue figures are not
> random and one of many evidence-based approaches to massive business
> growth is applying data science to help drive decisions that have
> direct high impacts on overall revenue generated (Kraus, 2018). Data
> science is the study of data to derive insights from and to take
> actions to reach a predetermined expected outcome.
>
> Within data science and the use of math and economics businesses apply
> predictive modeling to predict outcomes. In this context, companies
> use predictive modeling to show what future revenue would look like.
> This is a standard process companies use so they can adjust business
> operations accordingly to give them the highest revenue numbers
> possible currently and in the future (Gajewar, 2016). One of many ways
> to establish high revenue is from the use and execution of effective
> advertising to grow business. If advertising is used skillfully along
> with other revenue generating activities then this helps businesses
> accomplish a large magnitude of growth.
>
> Additionally, if skillful use of advertising is mastered there is a
> higher probability business can reach a hyper-growth business phase
> (Würfel, 2021). In this project, altogether, when businesses utilize
> previous advertising revenue performance to predict future revenue,
> assuming their business meets the criteria and has the capacity to
> enter a hyper-business growth phase, their probability to enter
> hyper-growth business mode is more likely to occur. The business
> problem that is investigated or solved is to reach the business status
> of hyper-growth through advertising from accurately predicting future
> revenue. If business revenue from past advertising is\
> strategically analyzed then it is possible to predict future revenue
> and increase the probability of achieving the hyper-growth business
> status.
>
> **Data & Methods:**
>
> The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle.com
> advertising sales dataset, a platform well-respected for hosting a
> wide range of high-quality and diverse datasets. Kaggle is a trusted
> environment among data scientists and business strategists who apply
> data-driven insights to solve real-world problems, making it an
> appropriate and credible source for this project. Given the project\'s
> aim --- helping businesses use advertising to predict and drive toward
> hyper-growth revenue --- it was essential to select data that
> specifically relates to advertising efforts and corresponding revenue
> performance. This dataset is a strong match because it reflects the
> core relationship between advertising activities and revenue
> generation, two critical\
> components to scale a business aggressively. Just as choosing the
> right data is crucial, the methodology applied to the data is equally
> important. For this project, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for
> Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework will be used as the guiding approach.
>
> This framework ensures that the process remains structured, strategic,
> and focused on business objectives. The project will move through the
> CRISP-DM phases as follows: (1) Confirming a deep business
> understanding and clearly defining the business problem --- in this
> case, predicting future revenue performance based on past advertising
> efforts to position companies for\
> hyper-growth. (2) Data understanding by exploring the dataset,
> identifying key patterns and potential predictors. (3) Preparing the
> data by cleaning, organizing, and constructing a version suitable for
> advanced analysis and predictive modeling. (4) Engaging in the
> modeling phase where predictive algorithms will be developed and tuned
> to forecast future revenue based on historical advertising
> performance. (5) Conducting a careful evaluation of the models,
> assessing how well they meet the business objectives, and refining as
> needed. (6) Deploying the final predictive model in a way that allows
> for ongoing adjustments and optimization to maintain alignment with
> business goals and maximize the probability of achieving hyper-growth
> success. Through using both a reputable data source and a strategic
> data science methodology, this project aims to contribute meaningful
> insights that give businesses their best statistical shot at reaching
> hyper business growth status.
>
> **Data Explore:**
>
> In the data explore phase, I examine the dataset\'s structure and key
> variables to understand how advertising performance correlates with
> revenue generation. The goal was to uncover important patterns that
> can help forecast future sales based on historical data, offering
> businesses actionable insights into the impact of their advertising
> strategies. The Kaggle advertising sales dataset provides detailed
> information on advertising expenditures across various channels, along
> with the corresponding revenue outcomes. This makes it a vital
> resource for analyzing the direct effects of advertising initiatives
> on sales performance. By exploring the relationships between revenue
> and advertising spend in different media the dataset only has TV,
> radio, and newspapers
>
> as advertising channels. The objective was to identify the most high
> impact factors that drove revenue growth.
>
> This dataset was very small but acts as a resource to be utilized to
> demonstrate the power of approaching solving a business problem and
> here it\'s reaching the hyper growth business phase.
>
> As stated earlier, there were only three predictor variables in this
> dataset. The three data predictors are all key to my analysis, which
> include TV advertising spend: The amount spent on TV ads. Radio
> advertising spend: The amount spent on radio ads. Newspaper
> advertising spend: The amount spent on newspaper ads. The last
> variable, revenue or sales, will be what I\'m looking to predict in
> the future so revenue generated is the sales or revenue produced as a
> result of the advertising efforts.
>
> By examining the correlations between advertising spend across these
> three media and the revenue generated, I can gain a deeper
> understanding of how each type of advertising impacts sales. This
> analysis will provide a clearer picture of which advertising channels
> offer the highest return on investment (ROI) and are most effective at
> driving revenue. Below is Figure 1, which paints a picture of a
> matrix. This matrix is a grid of scatter plots where each variable is
> plotted against every other variable, including the target, which is
> sales. The advertising spending on the different channels or TV, radio
> and newspaper are all compared to sales to explore patterns.
>
> Upon observing patterns in Figure 1 there is a low positive
> correlation of TV advertising to go along with sales generated.

> The initial step in this exploration involves calculating the
> correlation coefficients between these variables. This will help
> identify any strong linear relationships between advertising
> expenditures and revenue. If a significant correlation exists, it may
> suggest that past advertising efforts have a predictable effect on
> future sales. For instance, if the data shows a high positive
> correlation between TV advertising spend and revenue, it indicates
> that increasing TV ad spend could lead to higher sales, which will
> inform predictive modeling in the next steps of the project.
>
> Additionally, I will visualize these relationships through scatter
> plots and correlation heatmaps, allowing for a deep understanding of
> how each advertising medium influences sales\
> performance. The visual representation will further highlight any
> outliers or patterns that could inform more broader insights for
> future advertising campaigns.
>
> This exploration will also help uncover potential areas where certain
> advertising channels may not contribute as significantly to revenue,
> enabling businesses to reallocate resources more effectively.
> Ultimately, the aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of
> past advertising effectiveness, laying the foundation for predictive
> models that can project future sales with greater accuracy. By
> thoroughly exploring the dataset, this phase will undergo data
> preparation and modeling efforts, ensuring that the right features are
> used to predict future sales outcomes.

>
> **Model & Evaluation:**\
> During my modeling phase I applied a combination of mathematical or
> computational\
> infrastructure that captures relationships within the data. After
> careful review and reading other publications within this same core
> subject, I went with a 70/30 split for predicting future revenue from
> past advertising performance because having a larger test set allows
> for an effective evaluation of how well the model will perform on new,
> unseen data, such as actual future revenue. It's critical to believe
> in the model's predictions in real-world situations, so by me
> reserving 30% of the data for testing allows the evaluation to be more
> accurate. Additionally, using the 70% for training this lets the model
> keep a good amount of data to learn and highlight trends. Overall,
> when I considered the dataset and the project goals this split was a
> great balance and makes sense for this kind of forecasting objective.
>
> For this project, the objective is to predict future revenue based on
> historical advertising performance. By analyzing past advertising
> data, including TV, radio, and digital ad budgets, I sought to
> forecast the revenue generated from advertising expenditures. The
> modeling process helps in understanding how different advertising
> investments impact future revenue results so this allows business
> leaders to optimize future advertising effectively. To achieve high
> potential for maximum future revenue, I constructed different machine
> learning models to test so I could determine the most accurate method
> for predicting future revenue. My models were designed to discover
> complex, non-linear relationships between advertising spending across
> multiple channels and the revenue as an outcome that was generated.
> The Root Mean Squared Error
>
> (RMSE) metric was used to evaluate the models, as it expresses a
> measure of how far off the predicted revenue values are from the
> actual values.
>
> The first model I did the test with was a Multiple Linear Regression,
> which assumes a linear relationship between advertising budgets (TV,
> radio, and digital) and the revenue generated. This model acted as a
> general guide to understand how simple linear assumptions perform in
> this environment. The model provided insights into the relationship
> between advertising spend and revenue but it did not highlight the
> more complex patterns in the data, leading to a bad RMSE score.
>
> Next, I applied the Random Forest model. Random Forest builds multiple
> decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy.
> By identifying non-linear interactions and reducing overfitting,
> Random Forest is ideal for more complicated data relationships. In
> this case, its RMSE evaluation performance was bad and is under the
> threshold of an acceptable or passable model. The third model I tested
> was XGBoost, a gradient boosting method, which usually has a strong
> predictive power. The XGBoost corrects errors from previous models and
> optimizes for accuracy. This approach allowed XGBoost to appear to
> look like a good model but after evaluation the RMSE showed its
> accuracy was off by a wide margin but was better then other models
> tried.
>
> The fourth model, Linear Model using only TV & Radio Advertising
> spending, was a simple version of the linear regression model that
> considered only the TV and radio advertising efforts as predictors.
> This model helped isolate the effects of these two channels, it
> performed poorly in comparison to the more complex models. By not
> including newspaper advertising spend, it was likely that I would have
> a better predictive model since newspapers contributed the least when
> growing revenue compared to TV and radio. Regardless, the model did
> not meet standard performance metrics to be considered applicable for
> business use.
>
> Finally, the fifth model was the TV Ad Budget Only. Considering only
> the TV advertising efforts as the predictor for revenue, this model
> further simplified the problem by ignoring other advertising channels.
> After evaluation, it performed horribly, the RMSE indicated its
> predictions are largely off from the actual real revenue generated by
> advertising. The single predictor approach failed to account for the
> contributions of radio and newspaper ads, which are possibly critical
> factors or elements of success in generating revenue.
>
> Each of these models was evaluated using RMSE to quantify their
> predictive performance.
>
> Simple models such as Multiple Linear Regression and Linear Model
> using TV & Radio advertising efforts only provided useful insights,
> they were unable to highlight the complexity of the relationships
> between advertising spend and revenue. More advanced models like
> Random Forest and XGBoost were able to account for these complexities

>

>
> **Results, Discussion & Conclusion**
>
> The business problem to solve was to increase business revenue from
> creating a business model that predicts future revenue from past
> performance of advertising spending. From the predictions of future
> revenue along with other business strategies, assuming business has
> the capacity to grow exponentially, or economies of scale, a potential
> to have a greater probability of reaching the hyper growth business
> phases could be an added benefit from predicting future revenue.
>
> The results of all of the models do not meet the guidelines from
> standard model performance evaluations. This finding doesn\'t mean the
> project was a failure but simply shows the\
> evidence-based approach that uses data science to predict future
> revenue and add other elements of business growth that are outside of
> the context of this project. In conclusion, The project was a success
> because it aimed at showing one of many approaches to increase the
> realistic possibility of achieving the legendary status of a hyper
> growth business organization.
>
> Although all the predictive models failed the performance evaluation
> there are reasons why. There were various limitations and a couple are
> that the dataset only contained three advertising channels. Other
> constraints are that there were no time stamps nor a data sample large
> enough for a valid usable predictive model. The dataset does not show
> how sales and advertising spend change over time. Future improvement
> would be to add more data and have the project be able to see the
> impacts of advertising over a span of time. To predict the future, you
> usually need data that shows what happened month by month, week by
> week, or day by day --- so you can see trends, patterns, and delays.
> Lastly, regardless of the findings, this research can still be used
> because it\'s a universal approach. Professionals and businesses can

> customize it to fit into their own pursuits to reach a result or final
> outcome that satisfies them.
